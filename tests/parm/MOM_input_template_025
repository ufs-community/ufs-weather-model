! This input file provides the adjustable run-time parameters for version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6).
! Where appropriate, parameters use usually given in MKS units.

! This particular file is for the example in ice_ocean_SIS2/OM4_025.

! This MOM_input file typically contains only the non-default values that are needed to reproduce this example.
! A full list of parameters for this example can be found in the corresponding MOM_parameter_doc.all file
! which is generated by the model at run-time.
