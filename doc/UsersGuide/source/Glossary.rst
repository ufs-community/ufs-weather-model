   advect
      To transport substances in the atmostphere by :term:`advection`.

   advection
      According to the American Meteorological Society (AMS) `definition <https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Advection>`__, advection is "The process of transport of an atmospheric property solely by the mass motion (velocity field) of the atmosphere." In common parlance, advection is movement of atmospheric substances that are carried around by the wind.

   ATM
      The Weather Model configuration that runs only the standalone atmospheric model. 

   AQM
      The `Air Quality Model <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/AQM>`__ (AQM) is a UFS Application that dynamically couples the Community Multiscale Air Quality (:term:`CMAQ`) model with the UFS Weather Model through the :term:`NUOPC` Layer to simulate temporal and spatial variations of atmospheric compositions (e.g., ozone and aerosol compositions). The CMAQ, treated as a column chemistry model, updates concentrations of chemical species (e.g., ozone and aerosol compositions) at each integration time step. The transport terms (e.g., :term:`advection` and diffusion) of all chemical species are handled by the UFS Weather Model as :term:`tracers<tracer>`.

   CCPP
      The `Common Community Physics Package <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp>`__ is a forecast-model agnostic, vetted collection of code containing atmospheric physical parameterizations and suites of parameterizations for use in Numerical Weather Prediction (:term:`NWP`) along with a framework that connects the physics to the host forecast model.

   CCPP-Framework
     The infrastructure that connects physics schemes with a host model; also refers to a software
     repository of the same name 

   CCPP-Physics
      The pool of CCPP-compliant physics schemes; also refers to a software repository of the same name

   CDEPS
      The `Community Data Models for Earth Predictive Systems <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/CDEPS/>`__ repository (CDEPS) contains a set of :term:`NUOPC`-compliant data components and :term:`ESMF`-based "stream" code that selectively removes feedback in coupled model systems. In essence, CDEPS handles the static Data Atmosphere (:term:`DATM`) integration with dynamic coupled model components (e.g., :term:`MOM6`). The CDEPS data models perform the basic function of reading external data files, modifying those data, and then sending the data back to the :term:`CMEPS` mediator. The fields sent to the :term:`mediator` are the same as those that would be sent by an active component. This takes advantage of the fact that the mediator and other CMEPS-compliant model components have no fundamental knowledge of whether another component is fully active or just a data component. More information about DATM is available in the `CDEPS Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/html/index.html>`__.

   CESM
      The `Community Earth System Model <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/>`__ (CESM) is a fully-coupled global climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (:term:`NCAR`) in collaboration with colleagues in the research community. 

   chgres_cube
      The preprocessing software used to create initial and boundary condition files to "coldstart" the forecast model. It is part of :term:`UFS_UTILS`. 

   CICE
   CICE6
   Sea Ice Model
      `CICE <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/CICE>`__ is a computationally efficient model for simulating the growth, melting, and movement of polar sea ice. It was designed as one component of a coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-ice global climate model. CICE has several interacting components, including a model of ice dynamics, a transport model that describes :term:`advection` of different state variables; and a vertical physics package called "Icepack". 

   CMAQ
      The `Community Multiscale Air Quality Model <https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/cmaq-models-0>`__ (CMAQ, pronounced "cee-mak") is a numerical air quality model that predicts the concentration of airborne gases and particles and the deposition of these pollutants back to Earth's surface. The purpose of CMAQ is to provide fast, technically sound estimates of ozone, particulates, toxics, and acid deposition. CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Code is publicly availably at https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. 

   CMEPS
      The `Community Mediator for Earth Prediction Systems <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/CMEPS>`__ (CMEPS) is a :term:`NUOPC`-compliant :term:`mediator` used for coupling Earth system model components. It is currently being used in NCAR's Community Earth System Model (:term:`CESM`) and NOAA's subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) coupled system. More information is available in the `CMEPS Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CMEPS/versions/master/html/index.html>`__.

   cron
   cron job
   crontab
   cron table
      Cron is a job scheduler accessed through the command-line on UNIX-like operating systems. It is useful for automating tasks such as regression testing. Cron periodically checks a cron table (aka crontab) to see if any tasks are are ready to execute. If so, it runs them. 

   DATM
      DATM is the *Data Atmosphere* component of :term:`CDEPS`. It uses static atmospheric forcing files (derived from observations or previous atmospheric model runs) instead of output from an active atmospheric model. This reduces the complexity and computational cost associated with coupling to an active atmospheric model. The *Data Atmosphere* component is particularly useful when employing computationally intensive Data Assimilation (DA) techniques to update ocean and/or sea ice fields in a coupled model. In general, use of DATM in place of :term:`ATM` can be appropriate when users are running a coupled model and only want certain components of the model to be active. More information about DATM is available in the `CDEPS Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/html/datm.html>`__.

HAFS development targets an operational analysis and forecast system for hurricane forecasters with reliable, robust and skillful guidance on TC track and intensity (including rapid intensification), storm size, genesis, storm surge, rainfall, and tornadoes associated with TCs. Currently, HAFS is under active development with collaborative efforts among NCEP/EMC, AOML/HRD, GFDL, ESRL/GSD, ESRL/NESII, OFCM/AOC, and NCAR/DTC.

   HYCOM
      The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (`HYCOM <https://www.hycom.org/>`__) was developed to address known shortcomings in the vertical coordinate scheme of the Miami Isopycnic-Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM). HYCOM is a primitive equation, general circulation model with vertical coordinates that remain isopycnic in the open, stratified ocean. However, the isopycnal vertical coordinates smoothly transition to z-coordinates in the weakly stratified upper-ocean mixed layer, to terrain-following sigma coordinates in shallow water regions, and back to z-level coordinates in very shallow water. The latter transition prevents layers from becoming too thin where the water is very shallow. See the `HYCOM User's Guide <https://www.hycom.org/attachments/063_hycom_users_guide.pdf>`__ for more information on using the model. The `HYCOM model code <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/HYCOM-src>`__ is publicly available on GitHub.
