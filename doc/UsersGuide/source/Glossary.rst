   CCPP
      Model agnostic, vetted, collection of codes containing atmospheric physical parameterizations
      and suites for use in NWP along with a framework that connects the physics to host models

   CCPP-Framework
     The infrastructure that connects physics schemes with a host model; also refers to a software
     repository of the same name 

   CCPP-Physics
      The pool of CCPP-compliant physics schemes; also refers to a software repository of the same name

   FMS
     The Flexible Modeling System (FMS) is a software framework for supporting the efficient
     development, construction, execution, and scientific interpretation of atmospheric, 
     oceanic, and climate system models.

   NEMS
      The NOAA Environmental Modeling System - a software infrastructure that supports 
      NCEP/EMCâ€™s forecast products.

   NUOPC
      The National Unified Operational Prediction Capability is a consortium of Navy, NOAA,
      and Air Force modelers and their research partners. It aims to advance the weather
      modeling systems used by meteorologists, mission planners, and decision makers. NUOPC
      partners are working toward a common model architecture - a standard way of building
      models - in order to make it easier to collaboratively build modeling systems.

   Parameterization or physics scheme
      The representation, in a dynamic model, of physical effects in terms of admittedly
      oversimplified parameters, rather than realistically requiring such effects to be 
      consequences of the dynamics of the system (AMS Glossary)

   Suite Definition File (SDF)
     An external file containing information about the 
     construction of a physics suite. It describes the schemes that are called, in which
     order they are called, whether they are subcycled, and whether they are assembled
     into groups to be called together

   Suite
      A collection of primary physics schemes and interstitial schemes that are known to work
      well together

   UFS
      A Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth
      system modeling system. The UFS numerical applications span local to global domains
      and predictive time scales from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is
      designed to support the Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA's
      operational numerical weather prediction applications

   Weather Model
      A prognostic model that can be used for short- and medium-range research and 
      operational forecasts. It can be an atmosphere-only model or be an atmospheric
      model coupled with one or more additional components, such as a wave or ocean model.
