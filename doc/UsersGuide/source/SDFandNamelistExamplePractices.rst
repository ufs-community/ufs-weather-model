SDF and Namelist Samples and Best Practices
********************************************

The public release of the UFS MR Weather App includes four supported physics suites:
GFS_v15p2, GFS_v15p2_no_nsst, GFS_v16beta, and GFS_v16beta_no_nsst. You will
find the Suite Definition Files (SDFs) for these suites in

https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/fv3atm/tree/ufs-v1.1.0/ccpp/suites

(no other SDFs are available with this release). You will find the namelists for the C96 configuration here:

https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model/tree/ufs-v1.1.0/parm/ccpp_v15p2_c96.nml.IN

and

https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model/tree/ufs-v1.1.0/parm/ccpp_v16beta_c96.nml.IN

As noted in the file names, these namelists are for the operational (v15p2) and developmental (v16beta)
GFS suites. Each of these namelists are relevant to the suites with and without the SST prediction scheme, that is,
they are relevant for the suite that employs NSST and for the suite that employs the simple ocean
model (`no_nsst`). The only difference in the namelist regarding how SST prediction is
addressed is variable `nstf_name`. For more information about this variable and for information about
namelist options for higher resolution configurations, please consult the
`CCPP v4.1.0 Scientific Documentation <https://dtcenter.org/GMTB/v4.1.0/sci_doc/>`_.

The four CCPP suites for the UFS MR Weather App release are supported in four grid resolutions:
C96, C192, C384, and C768, with 64 vertical levels.

An in depth description of the namelist settings, SDFs, and parameterizations used
in all supported suites can be found in the `CCPP v4.1.0 Scientific Documentation <https://dtcenter.org/GMTB/v4.1.0/sci_doc/>`_.
Note both suites do not
use stochastic physics by default, but the stochastic physics can be activated following the
instructions described in the `stochastic physics v1.1 user's guide <https://stochastic-physics.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v1.1.0/>`_.

Both the SDF and the *input.nml* contain information about how to specify the physics suite.
Some of this information is redundant, and the user must make sure they are compatible. The
safest practice is to use the SDF and namelist provided for each suite, since those are
supported configurations.

Changes to the SDF must be accompanied by corresponding changes to the namelist. While there
is not a one-to-one correspondence between the namelist and the SDF, :numref:`Table %s <PBLVarOptions>`
shows some variables in the namelist that must match the SDF.

\*\*The CIRES Unified Gravity Wave Physics (cires_ugwp) scheme is used in GFSv15p2* and GFSv16beta* SDFs with do_ugwp=F in the namelist. In this setting, the cires_ugwp calls the operational GFS v15.2 orographic gravity wave drag (gwdps) scheme. When do_ugwp=T, the  cires_ugwp scheme calls an experimental orographic gravity wave (gwdps_v0).

**Note that some namelist variables are not available for use with CCPP.**

   * **do_deep**. In order to disable deep convection, it is necessary to remove the deep convection scheme from the SDF.
   * **shal_cnv**. In order to disable shallow convection, it is necessary to remove the deep convection scheme from the SDF.
   * **ldiag3d** and **ldiag_ugwp**. Must be F for CCPP runs.
   * **gwd_opt**. Ignored in CCPP-supported suites.

**When certain parameterizations are turned on, additional namelist options can be used (they are ignored otherwise).
Some examples are shown in** :numref:`Table %s <EnabledNMLOptions>`.
