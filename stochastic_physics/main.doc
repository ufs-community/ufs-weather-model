 *The stochastic physics currently only works with the UFS-atmosphere model
 *
 *Currently, 3 stochastic schemes are used operationally at NCEP/EMC: Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (SKEB; Berner et al., 2009), Stochastically Perturbed Physics Tendencies (SPPT; Palmer et al., 2009), and Specific Humidity perturbations (SHUM), which is inspired by Tompkins and Berner, 2008. In addition there is the ability to perturb certain land model/surface parameters (Gehne et al, 2019), and a cellular automata scheme (Bengtsson et al. 20XX) which interacts directly with the convective parameterization.
 *
 *SKEB adds wind perturbations to model state.  Perturbations are random in space/time, but amplitude is determined by a smoothed dissipation estimate provided by the dynamical core.
 *Addresses errors in the dynamics  - more active in the mid-latitudes
 *
 *SPPT multiplies the physics tendencies by a random number O [0,2] before updating the model state.  Addresses error in the physics parameterizations (either missing physics or unresolved subgrid processes). It is most active in boundary layer and convective regions
 *
 *SHUM multiply the low-level specific humidity by a small random number each time-step. It attempts to address missing physics (cold pools, gust fronts), most active in convective regions
 *Land surface perturbations allow for land surface parameters such as Albedo, Soil Hydraulic Conductivity, LAI, and roughness lengths to vary in space. Addresses error in the land model and land-atmosphere interactions
 *
 *Due to the modelâ€™s numerics, any stochastic perturbation needs to be correlated in space and time in order to have the desired effect of upscale growth of the perturbations. This is achieved by creating a random pattern that has a specified decorrelation length-scale and is a first order auto-regressive process AR(1) in time with a specified decorrelation time-scale.  (The CA random pattern generator also satisfies this condition).
